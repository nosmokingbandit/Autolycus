SCORING COLUMNS. I swear some day this will make sense.

<4>
0-4
Resolution Match. Starts at 8.
Remove 1 point for the priority of the matched resolution.
So if we want 1080P then 720P in that order, 1080 movies will get 0 points
    removed, where 720P will get 1 point removed.
We do this because the jquery sortable gives higher priority items a lower
    number, so 0 is the most important item. This allows a large amount of
    preferred word matches to overtake a resolution match.

<3-1>
0-100
Add 10 points for every preferred word match.
